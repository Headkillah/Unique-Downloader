# Unique-Downloader
This downloader is created by me it works very uniquely .I am sharing this code because I faced many problems while making this so I do not want anyone else to face the Problems which I faced .And it is for non-commercial use I want you to learn from my code then code your own Downloader.Thanks!
     
                           --------------------------------How it works--------------------------------------
                           
                          1.It first gets the info of the file which you want to download using the Url
                          
                          2.Then it creats a folder and 6 different files named  1.ud, 2.ud ,3.ud ,4.ud, 5.ud and Info.txt
                          
                          3.It uses five threads to download files in parts by dividing the size of the file into 5 parts the 
                            last part can be big 
                            
                          4.And after completing the download process then it creats the master file of all the other 5 five files 
                            and saves the whole bytes into one file
